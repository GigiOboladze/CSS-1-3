        <h1>BIG BANG THEORIES</h1>
        <p id="stafilo">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics,
            philosophy, and metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</p>

        <div id="boxone">
            <h2 id="titleone">BIG BANG THEORY</h2>
            <p id="textone">This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The Big
                Bang theory suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years
                ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of
                the cosmos.</p>

        <div id="borderone">
            <h2 id="titletwo">BLACK HOLE THEORY</h2>
            <p id="texttwo">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions where gravity is
                so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can
                emit radiation.</p>

        <div id="boxthree">
        <h2 id="string">STRING THEORY</h2>
        <div id="stringp">
        <p id="stringb">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world. According to this
            theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional microscopic,
            non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with different sizes and
            characteristics.</p>
            </div>
        <h3 id="hereare">Here are things about String Theory:</h3>
        <ul id="uli">
            <li id="lione"><img src="images/Rectangle 2332.png" id="wer">Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that explains all
                fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum
                mechanics.</li>
            <li id="litwo"><img src="images/Rectangle 2332.png" id="wert">Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory proposes the existence of
                additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing the laws of physics.
            </li>
            <li id="lithree"><img src="images/Rectangle 2332.png" id="werti">Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are not
                point-like particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies, with
                each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.</li>
